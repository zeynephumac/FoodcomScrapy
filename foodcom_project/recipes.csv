Name:,Quick Gluten Free Cinnamon Rolls
Description:,"The idea to make these popped into my mind when I made **Jubes** Quick Gluten Free Scones #220200 for the first time. Instead of cutting out scones I rolled the flattened dough and thought that actually I could have filled it. So I made a second batch of dough and made up my own version of cinnamon roll filling. I really liked that they were not overly sweet as the dough is not sweetened. As usual, I used rice syrup, but will suggest honey which might be slightly sweeter. Instead of the pine nuts you can of course use any other nut you like. I thought about pecans and maple syrup for the filling - if anyone feels like trying that, please tell me how it turned out!"
Ingredients:,"2   cups    gluten-free bread mix, 2/3  cup    whipping cream,   water, 2   tablespoons    butter, softened , 2   tablespoons    honey, 1   teaspoon    cinnamon, 2   tablespoons    pine nuts, chopped "
Prep Time:,25mins
Serves:,14
Directions:
- Preheat oven to 200 ° Celsius.
"- Mix gluten-free bread flour mix and cream lightly. You should just barely nead to get a soft dough. If it's too crumbly, add water by tablespoons until the consistency is so that you can just form a ball of dough to roll out."
- Roll the dough out between two sheets of nonstick baking paper into a rectangle as thinly as possible. I managed about 1/2 inch thickness.
"- Cream together butter, honey and cinnamon."
"- Gently brush the mixture on the dough, maybe using a knife or your fingers. If the mass is too solid to brush, lightly melt it in a water bath so that it becomes softer but not liquid."
- Sprinkle with chopped pine nuts.
- Carefully roll the dough into a log.
"- Using a sharp knife dusted with some rice flour, cut it into 14 rolls."
"- If the filling is too runny, cover the log with cling-wrap and let it settle in the fridge for some minutes, then cut into rolls."
"- Place rolls on a baking tray layered with baking paper. As **Jubes** suggests, put them together close to assist rising."
- Brush the top of the rolls with milk.

Name:,Perfect Cauliflower Pizza Crust
Description:,"From: Detoxinista.com 

A grain-free alternative to traditional pizza crust, that you can pick up with your hands!  Had to save for my cookbook!"
Ingredients:,"4   cups    raw cauliflower, riced  or 1   medium    cauliflower head, 1       egg, beaten , 1   cup    chevre cheese or 1   cup   other soft cheese, 1   teaspoon    dried oregano, 1   pinch    salt"
Prep Time:,1hr 10mins
Serves:,4
Directions:
- Preheat your oven to 400°F.
"- To make the cauliflower rice, pulse batches of raw cauliflower florets in a food processor, until a rice-like texture is achieved."
"- Fill a large pot with about an inch of water, and bring it to a boil. Add the “rice” and cover; let it cook for about 4-5 minutes. Drain into a fine-mesh strainer."
"- THIS IS THE SECRET: Once you’ve strained the rice, transfer it to a clean, thin dishtowel. Wrap up the steamed rice in the dishtowel, twist it up, then SQUEEZE all the excess moisture out! It’s amazing how much extra liquid will be released, which will leave you with a nice and dry pizza crust."
"- In a large bowl, mix up your strained rice, beaten egg, goat cheese, and spices. (Don’t be afraid to use your hands! You want it very well mixed.) It won’t be like any pizza dough you’ve ever worked with, but don’t worry– it’ll hold together!"
"- Press the dough out onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. (It’s important that it’s lined with parchment paper, or it will stick.) Keep the dough about 3/8” thick, and make the edges a little higher for a “crust” effect, if you like."
"- Bake for 35-40 minutes at 400°F The crust should be firm, and golden brown when finished."
"- Now’s the time to add all your favorites– sauce, cheese, and any other toppings you like. Return the pizza to the 400F oven, and bake an additional 5-10 minutes, just until the cheese is hot and bubbly."
- Slice and serve immediately!

Prep Time:,10hrs 45mins
Serves:,4
Directions:
"- To make the pulled pork: In a medium bowl, whisk together all the spices. Set aside."
"- Rub spice mixture evenly over the pork, store any extra spice rub in an airtight container with the rest of your spices. You can cook the pork right away but ideally marinate the pork in the spice rub for 4 hours or even overnight."
"- Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Place a long piece of foil across a half sheet tray so there is some hanging off both sides. Then place another long piece of foil going in the opposite direction. Place the seasoned pork, fat side up, in the center of the foil and toss to coat with the olive oil. Tightly cover the pork with the foil, keeping the foil seam on the top. Place in the oven and cook for 3 hours. Remove the pork from the oven and carefully open the foil pack so the top is exposed but so that the foil is still catching the juices released from the pork. Place the pork back in the oven and cook an additional 2 ½ - 3 hours or until the pork is tender and easily shreds with a fork. Remove from the oven and turn on the broiler."
- To make the BBQ sauce: While the pork is cooking make the BBQ sauce. Drain the dates and chiles from the warm water once they have softened. Add chilies to the sauce based on your spice preference. Place all the ingredients in a blender and blend on high until the sauce is smooth and shiny. Season with salt and remove to an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to serve.
"- To make the Whole30 mayo: Place the yolks, mustard, lemon juice and garlic in a blender and blend on high until smooth and combined. With the blender running slowly stream in the oil until the mixture emulsifies and forms mayonnaise. Season to taste with salt. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to serve. You can use it right away but I like to serve it the next day after the garlic has flavored the mayo."
"- To make the coleslaw: In a large bowl combine the cabbages, fennel, apple, red onion, parsley, lemon juice and vinegar. Fold in enough mayo to lighten the coleslaw in color and give a creamy taste, up to a ¼ cup. Taste and season with salt. Refrigerate until ready to serve."
- To serve: Top the pork with 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce and place under the broiler for 4-5 minutes or until the sauce has caramelized. Remove from the oven and shred the pork into bite sized pieces. Toss the pork with more of the BBQ sauce. Serve the remaining BBQ sauce on the side with the coleslaw.
- All leftovers hold well in the refrigerator for up two days except for the BBQ sauce which will hold in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

Name:,Quinoa Pudding
Description:,"Native to South America, quinoa is rich in fiber, protein and other nutrients.  This is a lovely variation on the more common rice pudding and is best served warm.  The final product is firm and can be sliced.  Top with your favorite fruit and this dessert makes for a terrific breakfast. Since I tend to not like my desserts very sweet, I usually make this with 2/3 cup sugar or a combination of sugar and Splenda. (For Core followers, you can make this Core bu skipping the currants and nuts, and replacing the sugar with Splenda.  Add the Splenda towards the end to avoid the artificially sweetened taste.)"
Ingredients:,"1   cup    quinoa, cleaned  (6 oz), 6   cups    water, 2       eggs, 2       egg whites, 1   cup    nonfat milk, 2   tablespoons   dry non-fat powdered milk, 1   teaspoon    vanilla, 3/4  cup    sugar, plus , 1   tablespoon    sugar, 1/8  teaspoon    salt, 1/4  cup    slivered almonds or 1/4  cup   chopped almonds, 1/4  cup    dried currant, 1/8  teaspoon    cinnamon,   cooking spray"

"- Pour the cherry filling into the spring form pan. Then, gently pour the chocolate filling into the center of the cherry filling. Take your time pouring the filling so that it stays in the middle. Tap the spring form pan on the table as needed to settle the filling. Next, slowly pour in the vanilla filling into the center of the chocolate filling. Again, tap the pan on the table to settle the filling. Use a toothpick to drag the top of the cheesecake to make a design on top."

Prep Time:,2hrs 15mins
Serves:,12-14
Directions:
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour.
- 1/3 cup water.
- 2 tsp active dried yeast.
- 1 cup lukewarm water.
- 4 cups plus 2 tbsp all-purpose flour.
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar.
- 1 tsp salt.
- ¼ cup vegetable oil.
"- Vegetable oil, for frying."
- 1 cup powdered sugar.
- 1 ½ to 2 ½ tbsp soy cream or non-dairy milk.
- 1 tsp vanilla extract.
- Food gel colouring.
- Small sprinkles.
- Stir the ¼ cup of flour and 1/3 cup water together in a small pot. Place over a medium heat on the stove and cook until the mixture has thickened into a stiff paste. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.
"- In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the yeast and lukewarm water. Let it stand for 10 minutes until bubbly. Add the cooled paste you made earlier, the flour, sugar, salt and vegetable oil to the bowl of the stand mixer. With the dough hook attached, knead the dough in the mixer for 6 minutes on a medium speed until smooth and elastic. Pour a little bit of oil into the bowl and turn the dough so that the oil coats the dough. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 2 hours."
"- Once risen, punch the dough down and tip out onto a floured counter. Roll out to be 1/4-inch thick and use a 3-inch round cutter (or a glass that width) to punch out circles from the dough. Use a pastry tip to cut out the centre of each circle to make the doughnut hole. Place onto a floured baking tray and cover with a damp tea towel, leave in a warm place for 30 minutes to rise."
- Heat ½-inch depth of vegetable oil in a deep frying pan to 350oF. Gently lower in a few dougnuts into the oil. Let fry until golden underneath then flip and let it cook until the other side is golden. Remove to a baking tray lined with kitchen paper.
"- For the glaze, stir together the powdered sugar, vanilla extract and soy cream in a medium bowl until you get a thick but drizzleable glaze. Divide between 4 small bowls. Leave one white. Colour one a very pale blue. Colour one a dark blue/purple. Colour another pink. Dollop a few dots of the dark blue and pink glaze into the light blue glaze. Swirl a few times with a spoon just to lightly combine then drizzle in some of the white glaze. Using a swooshing motion, dip a doughnut into the glaze and place glaze-side up on a wire rack to set. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts adding more of the dark blue/pink/white glaze to the bowl as needed. Decorate with a few sprinkles or edible glitter if you’d like for extra flair."

Name:,Garlic Soup That Cures What Ails You (Aka Hangover Soup)
Description:,"This is my favorite garlic soup of all. It is wonderful and each bite is as memorable as the first. This garlic soup differs from the ordinary garlic soup as it is hearty but also elegant. It is the kind of soup a person craves when recovering from a cold or a broken heart. It has cured a number of hangovers over the years although scrawled above the recipe I have written “Do not attempt to make with a really really bad hangover!!!!” – and I heed that warning, so plan ahead (I am pretty sure it means not to make it with a real bad hangover if you have to also make the stock). The combination of garlic, herbs and cloves is magic; the tomato juice adds zip and the unctuous egg yolk enrichment is balanced by the pasta’s pleasant, soothing note. This will cure whatever ails you….For an even heartier entr&eacute;e; place a poached egg on each cro&ucirc;te before ladling the soup over it. Wonderful! This soup is best when made with my Browned Vegetable Stock recipe (#150683), you could use other stock, but it would be a real shame…. a real shame…. so heighten your experience and make the stock as well… you won’t be sorry. For a fine-but-not-fussy meal you’ll be proud to set before anyone, try this soup with THE Salad (“the” Salad Recipe #150702) … because you can never have too much garlic! LOL! Finish with a fruity dessert like a really good baked apple made with brown sugar and served with gingerbread and a dollop of yogurt….. yummy!"
Ingredients:,"2   large    heads of garlic, separated into cloves, unpeeled , 6   cups   any well-flavored chicken stock or 6   cups   well-flavored vegetable stock, 3       whole cloves, 1/2  teaspoon    dried sage, 1/2  teaspoon    dried leaf thyme, 3   sprigs    parsley,   pepper, to taste , 2   cups    tomato juice (I only use low sodium V8) or 2   cups   v 8 vegetable juice (I only use low sodium V8), 3/4  cup    alphabet pasta or 3/4  cup   other small shell pasta, 3       egg yolks, 6 -8       garlic bread, croutes  (I use Garlic Bread Croutes <a href=""https://www.food.com/recipe/garlic-bread-cro-tes-150700"">Garlic Bread Cro&ucirc;tes</a>), 4 -6   ounces    sharp cheddar cheese (or a combination of cheddar & Monterey) or 4 -6   ounces    monterey jack cheese, shredded  (or a combination of cheddar & Monterey),  finely minced fresh parsley or   cilantro, for garnish , 1      ripe avocado, pitted, peeled and sliced, for garnish  (optional)"
Prep Time:,1hr
Serves:,8
Directions:
"- In a large stock soup pot combine the garlic, stock, cloves, sage thyme, and parsley. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to medium-low, and let simmer gently, uncovered for 45 to 60 minutes. Strain the soup, pressing down the solids with the back of a wooden spoon to extract most of the garlic from the peels. Scrape garlic purée from the underside of the strainer into the broth. Discard the garlic peels and the spent herbs."
- Add the tomato or V8 juice to the strained soup and bring it to a boil. Drop in the pasta and let it cook until done – 5 minutes for alphabets and 8-10 minutes for the larger shapes.
- Meanwhile beat the egg yolks in a small bowl.
- Put a croûte in each soup bowl and top with a handful of grated cheese.
"- When the pasta is done, ladle out a little of the hot soup into the beaten egg yolks. Whisk together, and then whisk this mixture into the soup pot. The soup should thicken almost immediately. Remove the pot from the heat, and ladle the soup over the cheese-covered croûtes. Garnish each serving with a sprinkle of parsley and/or cilantro, and top with a few slices of ripe avocado. Enjoy!"

- Remove kale leaves from the stem and chop into bite sized pieces (or tear using hands).
"- Place kale in a large bowl and drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil and salt into leaves, massaging with hands. Do this for a few minutes, massaging the olive oil well into the leaves. Set aside. (Leaves should begin to wilt a little.)."

"- Add the avocado, berries and seeds and toss all together. Do not add the dressing, avocado, berries or seeds to the salad until just before serving."
